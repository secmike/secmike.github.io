I'm Michael, a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Arkansas. I am interested in malware research, open-source intelligence gathering, intrusion detection/prevention, et cetera. This blog is my playground for exploring and learning about a wide range of cyber security topics. I am excited to share what I learn with a larger community, sparking insightful discussions and mutual learning along the way.
